### What is M+ Team hub?
M+ Team hub is an app where you and your m+ team can plan schedule play sessions, share routes and more.
The motivation for creating the app stemmed from increasing difficulty of scheduling pushing sessions with schedules overlapping. Every solution we found felt clunky, syncing personal calendars? I don't want the people I am pushing keys with to see what I have on my calendar. Spreadsheets? Clunky and time-inefficient. The solution? M+ team hub. 

The app is currently in early stages of development. More to come.
